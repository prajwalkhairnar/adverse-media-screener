    "text_content": "A running list of Elon Musk's biggest controversies\nThe head of DOGE has nearly unprecedented access to the White House\nTesla founder Elon Musk is embroiled in many controversies. This has been turbocharged in the wake of his government position following President Donald Trump's reelection \u2014 and his recent, eventual falling-out with the president. Many in the U.S. increasingly view him as a lightning rod figure.\nTrump and DOGE\nMusk generated significant controversy for his closeness to President Donald Trump. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump get elected in 2024, according to FEC filings, and previously referred to himself as the president's \"first buddy.\"\nDespite reports that Trump was growing tired of Musk's continual presence, the world's richest man swiftly became one of Trump's closest allies and \"was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago,\" said Business Insider. Musk was appointed by Trump to helm the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a federal commission.\nThe Week\nThe Week provides readers with a wide range of perspectives from 200 trusted news sources.\nSign up for The Week's Free Newsletters\nFrom our daily WeekDay news briefing to an award-winning Food & Drink email, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox.\nFrom our daily WeekDay news briefing to an award-winning Food & Drink email, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox.\nControversies surrounding DOGE began almost immediately. The commission \"appears to be focusing on technology and personnel in its stated goal to cut government spending,\" said NPR. This included major cuts to the foreign aid agency USAID and the Education Department, as well as an overhaul of the U.S. Treasury Department, which involved a DOGE staffer being \"put in charge of the Treasury Department's system that processes trillions of dollars in payments every year.\" Musk has reportedly also used his government resources to crack down on dissent; DOGE is allegedly \"using artificial intelligence to surveil at least one federal agency's communications for hostility to President Donald Trump and his agenda,\" said Reuters.\nMany Americans have felt Musk had vast control over portions of the government \u2014 even though they didn't want him to; 51% of Americans thought he had significant influence over Trump, but only 13% thought this was a good thing, according to a February 2025 YouGov survey.\nFalling-out with Trump\nThe White House honeymoon ended less than six months after it began. A \"widening rift between the two\" came amid reports that they were already drifting apart, said the BBC. Then Musk parted ways with his government job at the end of May 2025, and soon after, he began criticizing Trump's spending bill \u2014 which would add trillions to the national deficit \u2014 calling it a \"disgusting abomination.\"\nNext, Musk and Trump began launching a barrage of controversial comments at each other on social media, with Musk's words reflecting \"wider tensions among Republicans over the plan,\" said the BBC. The pair's working relationship appeared to completely collapse, with Musk insinuating that Trump was a pedophile because his name allegedly appeared in files connected to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day \u2013 and the best features from TheWeek.com\nLater things cooled down, as Musk later deleted his post on X about Trump and Epstein, saying his words \"went too far.\" Trump was \"surprised\" and \"not a happy camper\" about the situation, but is open to forgiving Musk, the president said on the Pod Force One podcast. Still, many say the pair's relationship may be irreparably damaged.\nAlthough Musk may no longer be part of the government, experts say that DOGE's influence will remain intact. Trying to get DOGE out of the federal landscape \"would be like trying to remove a drop of food coloring from a glass of water,\" said Wired.\nElection financing\nPrior to their rift, Musk was a major financier for the president. Musk \"spent $280 million to buy an election for Donald Trump,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said at a press conference. He is \"here to collect on his investment. He is here to seize power for himself.\" This is just one way in which Musk has used his vast wealth to influence U.S. elections.\nThe former DOGE head has also previously handed out checks to people who pledged a conservative political PAC. He also became razor-focused on Wisconsin's April 1, 2025, Supreme Court election by financially supporting conservative candidate Brad Schimel, and controversially attended an event in Green Bay where he \"gave out $1 million checks\" to \"Wisconsin voters, declaring them spokespeople for his political group,\" said The Associated Press. In all, Musk and \"groups he supports have spent more than $20 million to help conservative favorite Brad Schimel,\" though Musk's backing may have turned voters off of Schimel, leading to his eventual loss.\nApparent Nazi salute\nAt an event celebrating Trump's inauguration, Musk raised an outstretched arm to the crowd in a manner reminiscent of a Nazi salute, while saying his \"heart goes out\" to them. Social media disagreed on whether or not Musk actually intended to give a Nazi salute; the historic salute \"consists of raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down,\" said the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which is indeed the gesture that Musk made. Many people, including Germans, said Musk made the salute on purpose. Whoever on a \"political stage, making a political speech in front of a partly far-right audience, elongates his arm diagonally in the air both forcefully and repeatedly, is making a Hitler salute. There's no such 'probably' or 'similar to' or 'controversial' about it,\" said German journalist Lenz Jacobsen, per The Guardian.\nWhile many people online accused Musk of making the Nazi salute, others weren't so sure \u2014 including the ADL itself. Musk \"made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,\" the organization said on X. However, the ADL later criticized Musk more harshly after he appeared to mock the controversy online. This was \"not the first time that Trump or someone close to him has been accused of sending fascist messages, even if they denied doing so,\" Matthew Kriner, a former director at Middlebury College's Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, said at The Conversation.\nInfluence in geopolitics\nOutside of the United States, Musk has also played a role in influencing politics in the European Union. While not directly involved in policy making, Musk is \"throwing grenades into Europe's political mainstream over issues ranging from immigration to free speech, creating a dilemma for governments,\" said The Wall Street Journal.\nThis includes weighing in on the debate over immigration in the United Kingdom and France, as well as calling for the U.K.'s King Charles III to dissolve Parliament. Musk also made controversial waves with his alleged support of AfD, a far right party in Germany accused of Nazi sympathies and labeled by Germany's intelligence domestic agency to be extremist. While AfD was boxed out of the government coalition following the country's election, it saw the best results for a far right party in Germany since World War II, as \"voter support flocks to AfD,\" said The Wall Street Journal. This is one area where the Trump administration and Musk continue agree post-rift, as Vice President J.D. Vance has praised AfD and criticized Germany for labeling it extremist.\nWhen it comes to EU leadership, many have \"urged Brussels to deploy its full legal might to reign in the billionaire tech magnate,\" said Politico, including further regulation of Musk's X. This may come to fruition sooner rather than later if the EU plays hardball, as Europe's Digital Services Act \"threatens eyewatering fines of up to 6% of global turnover, or even temporary blocks, in case of a breach.\"\nPurchasing Twitter\nMusk controversially acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, handing him control of one of the world's largest social media brands. Immediately after his purchase, there were major concerns over a few changes he made to the platform, which he rebranded as X.\nAntisemitic and racist tweets spiked after Musk's acquisition; in the first 24 hours after his purchase, more than \"1200 tweets and retweets\" had spread antisemitism, the Anti-Defamation League said. Hateful rhetoric towards Black people also increased, with The Washington Post finding a 500% increase in the use of the N-word on X just half a day after Musk's purchase.\nMusk himself also used the platform to spread hate, onlookers have alleged, and tweeted a link to an article spreading conspiracy theories about the 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Musk deleted the tweet hours later, his message \"echoed a wider effort by far-right influencers and some conservatives to downplay and spread baseless theories about the attack,\" Insider said.\n'Funding secured' post\nAside from X, Musk has faced legal battles surrounding the company that put him on the map: Tesla. One of the most notable involves a 2018 tweet in which Musk wrote that he had \"funding secured\" to take the company private at $420 per share.\nShareholders sued, however, when it was discovered that Musk had not secured the necessary financial backing at the time of this post. A U.S. District Judge said \"there was nothing concrete\" in Musk's tweet, per Reuters, and Musk had \"[acted] recklessly\" in posting about the funding. Tesla investors \"lost $12 billion over 10 days as a result\" of Musk's tweet, according to witness testimony from the trial obtained by Bloomberg. Musk was eventually found not liable for any losses experienced by the shareholders.\nMocking pronouns\nMusk has made his opinions on self-selected gender pronouns clear on multiple occasions. This includes posting that he was not a fan of self-identifying pronouns \"when someone is giving every possible visual cue for he or she, but then still insists on telling you exactly what you expect.\" Another notable instance occurred when he mocked the situation by posting, \"My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,\" a jab at the nation's top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, who has been targeted by conservatives for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nBoth of these tweets generated significant backlash. Musk shouldn't \"mock and promote hate toward already marginalized and at-risk-of-violence members of the LGBTQ+ community,\" said retired astronaut and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Dr. Fauci is a \"dedicated public servant whose sole motivation was saving lives.\"\nJustin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022. He began his career covering local news before joining Newsweek as a breaking news reporter, where he wrote about politics, national and global affairs, business, crime, sports, film, television and other news. Justin has also freelanced for outlets including Collider and United Press International.\n-\nThe 5 best narco movies of all time\nthe week recommends Cartels from hell and the greasy underside of the international drug trade\n-\nDisney bets big on AI, but not everyone sees a winner\nTalking Points The company will allow users to create their own AI content on Disney+\n-\nThe Beast in Me: a \u2018gleefully horrible story\u2019\nThe Week Recommends Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys star in a \u2018gleefully horrible story\u2019\n-\nIs Apple\u2019s Tim Cook about to retire?\nToday's Big Question A departure could come early next year\n-\nWhy Trump pardoned crypto criminal Changpeng Zhao\nIn the Spotlight Binance founder\u2019s tactical pardon shows recklessness is rewarded by the Trump White House\n-\nMicrosoft pursues digital intelligence \u2018aligned to human values\u2019 in shift from OpenAI\nUNDER THE RADAR The iconic tech giant is jumping into the AI game with a bold new initiative designed to place people first in the search for digital intelligence\n-\nDigital addiction: the compulsion to stay online\nIn depth What it is and how to stop it\n-\nIs the UK government getting too close to Big Tech?\nToday\u2019s Big Question US-UK tech pact, supported by Nvidia and OpenAI, is part of Silicon Valley drive to \u2018lock in\u2019 American AI with US allies\n-\nSouth Korea's divide over allowing Google Maps\nTalking Points The country is one of few modern democracies where the app doesn't work\n-\nGoogle avoids the worst in antitrust ruling\nSpeed Read A federal judge rejected the government's request to break up Google\n-\nGrok brings to light wider AI antisemitism\nIn the Spotlight Google and OpenAI are among the other creators who have faced problems",
